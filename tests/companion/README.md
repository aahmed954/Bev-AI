## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install companion testing dependencies
pip install -r tests/companion/requirements.txt

# Configure test environment
cp tests/companion/config/test_config.template.yaml tests/companion/config/test_config.yaml
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all companion tests
pytest tests/companion/ -v

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/companion/core/ -m "personality"
pytest tests/companion/performance/ -m "rtx4090"
pytest tests/companion/ux/ -m "voice_synthesis"

# Run with performance monitoring
pytest tests/companion/ --monitor-performance --generate-report
```

### Test Data Management
```bash
# Generate test personas and conversations
python tests/companion/data/generate_test_data.py

# Create performance baseline
python tests/companion/performance/establish_baseline.py

# Validate test environment
python tests/companion/validate_environment.py
```

## Reporting and Monitoring

### Test Reports
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live test execution monitoring
- **Performance Trends**: Historical performance tracking
- **User Experience Metrics**: Subjective quality measurements
- **Security Compliance**: Privacy and security validation reports

### Integration with Existing Monitoring
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Companion-specific performance metrics
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Visual performance and quality tracking
- **Alert System**: Automated notifications for test failures or degradation

## Contributing

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow the existing test structure and naming conventions
2. Include both automated and manual validation components
3. Ensure comprehensive error handling and cleanup
4. Add appropriate performance and quality metrics

### Test Development Guidelines
- Use realistic test data and scenarios
- Include edge cases and failure conditions
- Validate both technical metrics and user experience
- Ensure tests are reproducible and environment-independent
