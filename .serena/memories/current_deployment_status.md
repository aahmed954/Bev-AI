# BEV Project Current Deployment Status - September 20, 2025

## CRITICAL: PROJECT IS NOT READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

**CURRENT STATE:** Development and configuration phase
**DEPLOYMENT STATUS:** NOT WORKING - multiple configuration issues
**WORKING SERVICES:** Only basic development containers (redis, qdrant, open-webui)

## DO NOT USE THESE SCRIPTS (OUTDATED/BROKEN):
- ❌ ./deploy_everything.sh (OLD - from September 18)
- ❌ ./deploy_distributed_bev.sh (BROKEN - environment issues)
- ❌ ./deploy_local_distributed.sh (BROKEN - YAML syntax errors)

## CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX:
1. Docker Compose YAML syntax errors in thanos/oracle1 files
2. Environment variable parsing problems
3. Service configuration issues
4. Neo4j configuration errors
5. Cross-node networking not properly configured

## WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BEFORE DEPLOYMENT:
1. Fix all YAML syntax errors in docker-compose files
2. Create working environment files without parsing issues
3. Test individual services locally first
4. Validate configurations before attempting distributed deployment
5. Update documentation and memory when deployment actually works

## CURRENT WORKING APPROACH:
- Fixing configuration issues systematically
- Testing individual services before full deployment
- Using existing working containers as base

**STOP TRYING TO DEPLOY UNTIL CONFIGURATION IS FIXED**
