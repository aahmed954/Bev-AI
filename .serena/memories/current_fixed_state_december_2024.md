# BEV Project Current State - December 20, 2024

## CRITICAL: This is a MULTINODE deployment
- **NOTHING runs locally on Starlord** (development machine)
- **THANOS**: Primary node (local server, Ryzen 9 5900X, 64GB RAM, RTX 3080)
- **ORACLE1**: Secondary node (Oracle Cloud ARM64, 4 cores, 24GB RAM)
- **Username on all nodes**: starlord

## Project Location & Repository
- Local: `/home/starlord/Projects/Bev`
- GitHub: `https://github.com/aahmed954/Bev-AI.git`
- Deployment target on nodes: `/opt/bev`

## Total Service Count
- **151 unique services** defined across all docker-compose files
- Services distributed between THANOS and ORACLE1
- NOT all services start at once (would overwhelm nodes)

## Fixed Issues (December 20, 2024)
1. **Python Syntax Errors**: All fixed
   - security_framework.py indentation
   - intrusion_detection.py async/await
   - metadata_scrubber.py import syntax
   - multimodal_processor.py parenthesis
   - document_analyzer.py missing typing imports

2. **Docker Build Contexts**: All created
   - intelowl/custom_analyzers/* (4 analyzers)
   - phase7/* services (dm-crawler, crypto-intel, reputation-analyzer, economics-processor)
   - phase8/* services (tactical-intel, defense-automation, opsec-enforcer, intel-fusion)
   - phase9/* services (autonomous-coordinator, adaptive-learning, resource-manager, knowledge-evolution)
   - thanos/phase2-5/* directories with Dockerfiles

3. **Vault Credential Management**: Fully integrated
   - HashiCorp Vault deploys on THANOS
   - Centralized credential storage
   - ORACLE1 connects to THANOS Vault
   - No hardcoded passwords

## Key Files Created
- `fix-project-for-multinode.sh` - Fixes all project issues
- `generate-secure-credentials.sh` - Creates secure passwords
- `deploy-complete-with-vault.sh` - Full deployment with Vault
- `.env.secure` - Contains all credentials (NEVER commit!)
- `requirements-remote.txt` - Python dependencies for nodes

## Docker Compose Files
- `docker-compose.complete.yml` - All 151 services (reference)
- `docker-compose-thanos-unified.yml` - THANOS node services
- `docker-compose-oracle1-unified.yml` - ORACLE1 node services
- `docker-compose-phase7.yml` - Alternative market intelligence
- `docker-compose-phase8.yml` - Security operations
- `docker-compose-phase9.yml` - Autonomous systems

## Deployment Architecture
```
THANOS (Primary - x86_64 with GPU):
  ├── Vault Server (8200)
  ├── PostgreSQL (5432)
  ├── Neo4j (7474/7687)
  ├── Redis Cluster
  ├── Elasticsearch (9200)
  ├── Kafka Cluster
  ├── RabbitMQ
  ├── IntelOwl
  └── GPU Services (ML/AI)

ORACLE1 (Secondary - ARM64):
  ├── Prometheus (9090)
  ├── Grafana (3000)
  ├── Consul (8500)
  ├── InfluxDB
  ├── Redis Cache
  ├── Nginx Proxy
  └── Monitoring Services

STARLORD (Local - Development only):
  └── Git repository only, no services
```

## Current Git Status
- All fixes committed and pushed to GitHub
- Branch: main (some commits on enterprise-completion)
- Ready for deployment from GitHub to nodes

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. Run `./generate-secure-credentials.sh` to create passwords
2. Run `./deploy-complete-with-vault.sh` to deploy to nodes
3. Services will clone from GitHub and start with Vault integration

## Important Notes
- Services use Docker networks for inter-service communication
- Cross-node communication requires proper hostname resolution
- Vault must be started FIRST before other services
- Start services gradually, not all 151 at once
- Monitor with `docker ps` on each node
