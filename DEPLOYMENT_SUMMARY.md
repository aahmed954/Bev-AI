## üöÄ Definitive Working Deployment Commands

### Primary Deployment Sequence
```bash
# Complete deployment (recommended)
./deploy_bev_complete.sh full

# Individual node deployment
./deploy_bev_complete.sh thanos-only    # Primary compute
./deploy_bev_complete.sh oracle1-only   # ARM monitoring

# Validation and testing
./deploy_bev_complete.sh validate       # Run validation
./deploy_bev_complete.sh test           # Integration tests
```

### Deployment Workflow
```bash
# 1. Pre-deployment validation
./validate_complete_deployment.sh

# 2. Deploy THANOS (primary node)
./deploy_thanos_node.sh
# ‚Üí PostgreSQL, Redis, Neo4j, Elasticsearch, Vault, etc.

# 3. Deploy ORACLE1 (monitoring node)
./deploy_oracle1_node.sh
# ‚Üí Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager, Node Exporter

# 4. Test cross-node integration
./test_cross_node_integration.sh

# 5. Comprehensive health check
./health_check_all_services.sh
```

### Emergency & Management
```bash
# Emergency stop
./emergency_procedures.sh stop

# Create backup
./emergency_procedures.sh backup

# System recovery
./emergency_procedures.sh recover

# Health assessment
./emergency_procedures.sh health
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Verified

### THANOS Node (Primary)
- **Hardware**: x86_64, RTX 3080, 64GB RAM
- **Services**: 80+ containers
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Neo4j, Elasticsearch
- **Security**: Vault, Tor proxy integration
- **APIs**: IntelOwl, MCP server, custom analyzers

### ORACLE1 Node (Monitoring)
- **Hardware**: ARM64, 24GB RAM
- **Services**: 20+ containers
