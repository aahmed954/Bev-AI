class RequestMultiplexer:
    """
    High-performance request multiplexing with intelligent routing
    Optimizes request handling for maximum throughput
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.connection_pool = OptimizedConnectionPool()
        self.request_batcher = IntelligentBatcher()
        self.cache_optimizer = CacheOptimizer()

    async def multiplex_requests(self, requests: List[Request]) -> List[Response]:
        """Multiplexes requests for optimal performance and resource utilization"""
```
