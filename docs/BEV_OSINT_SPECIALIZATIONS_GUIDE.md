# BEV AI Assistant Platform - OSINT Specializations and Custom Analyzers

## Overview of OSINT Specializations

The BEV AI Assistant Platform features three major OSINT specialization areas, each representing thousands of lines of substantial implementation code designed to transform cybersecurity research capabilities. These specializations evolve the platform from a general AI assistant into a domain expert in alternative markets, security operations, and autonomous systems.

### **Specialization Scope**
- **Alternative Market Intelligence**: 5,608+ lines of darknet market and cryptocurrency analysis
- **Security Operations Center**: 11,189+ lines of enterprise security automation
- **Autonomous AI Systems**: 8,377+ lines of self-managing security infrastructure

**Total Implementation**: 25,174+ lines of specialized OSINT capabilities

## Alternative Market Intelligence System (5,608+ lines)

### **Core Purpose and Capabilities**
```
Location: src/alternative_market/
Purpose: AI-enhanced analysis of alternative markets, darknet ecosystems, and cryptocurrency crime
Scope: Comprehensive intelligence gathering for financial crime investigation
```

The Alternative Market Intelligence system represents cutting-edge financial crime investigation capabilities, combining AI-powered market analysis with advanced cryptocurrency tracking and reputation intelligence.
