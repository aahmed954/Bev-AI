# AUTONOMOUS BEV DEPLOYMENT FIXING - COMPLETE RESOLUTION PROTOCOL

## CRITICAL MISSION: FIX EVERY SINGLE DEPLOYMENT ISSUE

**Context**: After 30 hours of failed promises and broken deployments, systematically fix every single configuration error, port conflict, environment variable issue, and deployment problem until the COMPLETE BEV platform is 100% deployed and functional.

**Authorization**: Use ALL available tools, agents, MCP servers, and spend whatever time is required to achieve complete deployment success.
