## Emergency Response Overview

### Response Time Targets

| Severity | Initial Response | Resolution Target |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Critical (P0) | 15 minutes | 4 hours |
| High (P1) | 30 minutes | 8 hours |
| Medium (P2) | 2 hours | 24 hours |
| Low (P3) | 4 hours | 72 hours |

### Emergency Decision Matrix

```
High Impact + High Urgency = CRITICAL (P0)
High Impact + Low Urgency = HIGH (P1)
Low Impact + High Urgency = MEDIUM (P2)
Low Impact + Low Urgency = LOW (P3)
```

## Severity Classification

### Critical (P0) - Service Down

  - Unauthorized access to sensitive systems
  - Hardware failure affecting core infrastructure

### High (P1) - Degraded Service
- **Conditions:**
  - Single phase completely offline
  - Significant performance degradation (>50% response time)
  - Partial data loss or corruption
  - Security vulnerability detected

- **Examples:**
  - Phase 8 security services unavailable
  - Database performance issues affecting all services
  - Log data corruption
  - Potential security exploit discovered

### Medium (P2) - Limited Impact
- **Conditions:**
  - Individual service offline
  - Minor performance issues
  - Non-critical feature failures
  - Monitoring/alerting issues

- **Examples:**
  - Single service (e.g., dm-crawler) offline
